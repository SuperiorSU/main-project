API Usage Guidelines
1. Authentication Flow:
User registers via POST /api/members/register
System sends verification email
User verifies email via GET /api/members/verify/:token
User logs in via POST /api/members/login
Frontend stores JWT token in local storage
Include token in all authenticated requests:
2. Profile Management Flow:
Fetch profile via GET /api/members/profile
Update profile via PUT /api/members/profile
For skills and projects updates:
Send only the new skills/projects to be added
Backend will handle merging with existing data
3. Admin Management Flow:
Admin logs in via same login endpoint (system recognizes admin status)
Admin can view member lists with different filters
For member actions:
Use specific endpoints for each action
Refresh data after successful action
Error Handling
All screens should implement proper error handling:

Form validation errors (display inline)
API errors (display in notification/toast)
Authentication errors (redirect to login)
Special states:
Account suspended
Verification pending
Deleted account
Implementation Notes
Use JWT tokens for authentication
Implement responsive design for mobile compatibility
Consider accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1)
Store member-specific data in context/state management
Implement proper loading states for API requests
This UI documentation provides a comprehensive framework for implementing the frontend that works with the existing backend API structure.
